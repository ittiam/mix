## Quick Start

```bash
npm install -g create-mixup-app

create-mixup-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

Then open http://localhost:3000/ to see your app.


**That's it**. You don't need to worry about setting up multiple webpack configs or other build tools. Just start editing `src/main.js` and go!

Below is a list of commands you will probably find useful.

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the project in development mode.
You can view your application at `http://localhost:3000`

The page will reload if you make edits.

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the build folder.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!


### `npm start` or `yarn start`

To debug the node server, you can use `mixup start`. This will start the node server, enable the inspector agent and Break before user code starts.
